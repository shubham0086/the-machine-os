description: Create or evaluate an architecture decision record (ADR). Use when choosing between technologies (e.g., Kafka vs SQS), documenting a design decision with trade-offs and consequences, reviewing a system design proposal, or designing a new component from requirements and constraints.

Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) or evaluate a system design.

## Usage

```
/architecture $ARGUMENTS
```

## Modes

**Create an ADR**: "Should we use Kafka or SQS for our event bus?"
**Evaluate a design**: "Review this microservices proposal"
**System design**: "Design the notification system for our app"

See the **system-design** skill for detailed frameworks on requirements gathering, scalability analysis, and trade-off evaluation.

## Output — ADR Format

```markdown
# ADR-[number]: [Title]

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
**Date:** [Date]
**Deciders:** [Who needs to sign off]

## Context
[What is the situation? What forces are at play? Include technical constraints, current-state limitations, and business drivers.]

## Decision
[What is the change we're proposing? State clearly and directly.]

## Options Considered

### Option A: [Name]
| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Complexity | [Low/Med/High] |
| Cost | [Assessment] |
| Scalability | [Assessment] |
| Team familiarity | [Assessment] |

**Pros:**
- [Pro 1]
- [Pro 2]

**Cons:**
- [Con 1]
- [Con 2]

### Option B: [Name]
| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Complexity | [Low/Med/High] |
| Cost | [Assessment] |
| Scalability | [Assessment] |
| Team familiarity | [Assessment] |

**Pros:**
- [Pro 1]
- [Pro 2]

**Cons:**
- [Con 1]
- [Con 2]

## Trade-off Analysis
[Key trade-offs between options with clear reasoning. Explain why the selected option was chosen despite its associated cons.]

## Consequences
- **(+) Positive:** [What becomes easier, enabled, or decoupled as a result of this decision]
- **(-) Negative:** [What becomes harder, more complex, or what architectural debt/consequences we are actively accepting]
- **(~) Neutral:** [Changes that are neither inherently good nor bad, but alter standard operating procedures]

## Action Items
1. [ ] [Implementation step]
2. [ ] [Follow-up verification or telemetry monitoring setup]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for prior ADRs and design docs
- Find relevant technical context

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Link to related epics and tickets
- Create implementation tasks

## Tips

1. **State constraints upfront** — "We need to ship in 2 weeks" or "Must handle 10K rps" shapes the answer.
2. **Name your options** — Even if you're leaning one way, I'll give a more balanced analysis with explicit alternatives.
3. **Include non-functional requirements** — Latency, cost, team expertise, and maintenance burden matter as much as features.
